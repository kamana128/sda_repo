# Statstical Data Analysis Web Tool
## This is under development tool for data analysis.
### The aim of this project to make an open source web tool where student's can perform the data analysis for NWH and India Region for Temprature and Rainfall
## REF Working Images of project
Showing the Spatial plot for the minimum temprature.
User has the flexibility to choose the range of year over which they want to see the heat map over either NWH Region or IND region

Now Have a look on the Max temprature over the same region (A different Base map is used)

Also have this functionality to do the Quartile analysis

And can also be used for checking the relative increment between two dates

There are many more optins:
1 Select the Data
a. CRU 50 km
b. CRU 25km 
c IMDAA 12 km
d. CHIRP 5 km
2. Select the time period 
3. Select statistics (all these will be plots spatially)
a. Mean
b. Max
c. Min
d. Quartiles 
e. IQR
f. Relative increase 
g. Percentiles 
h. Temp and rainfall correlations 
i. Skewness 
j. Kurtosis 
k extreme years (outliers)
l. stationarity 

Many more functionality is under-developement....

Once everthing is completed this whole strealit app will be containerised with Doker and then deployed on to the Amazon EC2 instance.
